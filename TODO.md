# TODO

1. Fix annoying warning about storing char pointer in `long long` array.
2. Come up with proposed ASM syntax
3. Write lexer/parser for simple ASM
4. Proper call structure as outlined in that YouTube lecture that I am too lazy to link to. Some guy writes a simple VM in Java at a GNU/Linux Meetup.
